# Welcome to Memory Game

Memory Game was developed to improve skills with JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

# Structure

Project has the following structure:

## index.html

This file contains HTML code to create the layout and main sections of the application.

## css/style.css

This file contains CSS3 code to give a style to application. Memory Game uses CSS animations and it is implemented taking into account responsive design.

## js/app-js

This file contains the JavaScript code to program the application.
Cards are generated dynamically based on array of cards (array of JSON object) that indicates the icon, and if the card is matched or not with another one. This array of JSON objects is the main structure of the application and help us to paint the game board and make all application validations.
